# Github Stars

## Description
Just a python script that allows easy access to starred github repositories. Saves me having to go to the site every time and scroll through the list when I need to find a tool.

## Usage
Change the name of the user to pull stars from by modifying the "user" variable on line 4  
(Yes, this is dirty but who cares)
  
List repositories: `./ghstars`  
Clone repository: `./ghstars <star number>`
